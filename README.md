### Overview

This library provides a Kotlin implementation of a simple "standardized" 
protocol for sending and receiving packets between modules in multilayered 
systems such as JVM system process sand-boxing, RF communications such as 
BLE, serial/GPIO-based MCU interaction (such as a by-wire controller board 
for any one of myriad purposes), and other contexts wherein packets of a 
known format might benefit the mitigation of data integrity errors.
